# Lightweight Consensus Protocol

Lightweight consensus protocol for robots with communication constraints.

Originally developed for consensus among a team of underwater robots. Communication bandwidth is extremely low, of the order of tens of bytes per second. Our goal is to sue consensus to coordinate actions of the robots during multi-robot adaptive sampling in lakes.
